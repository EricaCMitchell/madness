# Numerical library

MADNESS provides a high-level environment for the solution of integral and differential equations 
in many dimensions using adaptive, fast methods with guaranteed precision based on multi-resolution 
analysis and novel separated representations. 

Useful examples can be found in the `src/examples` directory, where the use of the numerical library can be 
practiced by example.
 * `sininteg.cc`: Create a function and integrate
 * `hatom_energy.cc`: Compute the energy of the hydrogen atom 
 * `heat.cc`: apply the Greens function to the heat equation
 * `3dharmonic.cc`: solve the 3D harmonic oscillator
 * `h2.cc`: solve the Hartree-Fock equations for the H2 molecule
 * `nonlinschro.cc`: use the KAIN solver for accelerating the solution of a system of non-linear equations
 * `hedft.cc`: use density functional theory
