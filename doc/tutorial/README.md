## Downloading

From the command line, clone the [MADNESS GitHub repository](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness) using one of the below
* HTTPS
```
    git clone https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness.git
```
* SSH (for which you will need to have a GitHub account with SSH key)
```
    git clone git@github.com:m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness.git
```
This will make a new directory `madness` --- if you wish use a different name, append it to the command.

The head of the master branch usually builds and runs correctly due to the continuous integration.  If you are looking for the version tested for the Tromso June 2023 workshop, after cloning 
```
cd madness
checkout XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Building and installing

Please refer to the [installation instructions](https://madness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html).

Minimal recipe without MPI
```
mkdir build # CANNOT be in the madness source tree
cd build
cmake -DENABLE_MPI=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/me/madinstall /path/to/madness/source
make applications
make install  # optional
```
  
## Chemistry

* [Please look here](chemistry.md)

## Parallel runtime

Please refer to slides 166-189 in [MADNESSeverything4.pdf](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness/blob/tutorial/doc/MADNESSeverything4.pdf).
* Since the file is large, it is probably easier to look at your local version using your system PDF viewer

Hello world in MADNESS (runtime only --- numerical library is discussed below)
```
    #include <madness/world/MADworld.h>
    using namespace madness;

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        initialize(argc,argv);
        World world(SafeMPI::COMM_WORLD);

        print("Hello from processor",world.rank());

        finalize();
        return 0;
    }
```

## Numerical API

Please refer to the [Numerical Library User Documentation](https://madness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numerical_library.html) for a worked example.

* Setup up your project files 
  * Make a new directory (`test`) with two new sub-directories `src` and `build`
    * `mkdir test`
    * `cd test`
    * `mkdir src build`
  * Copy and paste the example cmake code into `src/CMakeLists.txt`
  * Copy and paste the example C++ into `src/main.cc`
* Setup your environment so cmake can find MADNES
  * `export MADNESS_DIR=/path/to/madness/install/directory/`
* Build the code
  * `cd build`
  * `cmake ../src`
  * `make`
* Execute
  * `MAD_NUM_THREADS=2 ./yourbinary`
  
[Developer documentation](https://m-a-d-n-e-s-s.github.io/madness/api-doc/) generated by doxygen
* Needs extensive updating and will (eventually) be mostly superseded by readthedocs
