README file for Joel Anderson's fork of MADNESS

Notes:
After configuration with cmake, you may need to go to <build directory>/src/madness/config.h and change the line:

/*undef HAVE_INTEL_MKL */

to:

def HAVE_INTEL_MKL 1

making sure that you do in fact have Intel MKL.

This is due to a bug that I don't know how to fix, where even if you have Intel MKL, cmake doesn't set the right preprocessing macros, and ends up compiling pieces of code without it.
